### How do I determine my chat ID number?

*I've got a bot setup, and I have a token, but how do I determine my chat ID number (also referred to as the channel ID)?*

#### Preferred Method

The easiest way is to login to the [Telegram Web Client](https://web.telegram.org/#/login) and find your channel on the left. When you select it the address in your URL bar will change.

* Copy the channel ID in your browser's address bar
  * It will look something like this:
    * ```#/im?p=g112345678```
  * *Just copy the numbers after **g** and make sure to include the (-) before the channel number*
    * Ex ```-#########```
    * Ex from above would be: ```-112345678```

#### Alternative method

Forward a message from your channel to the getidsbot [https://telegram.me/getidsbot](https://telegram.me/getidsbot)

### How can I use PoshGram to send inline Emojis?

There isn't a super elegant way to send inline Emojis.

#### Method 1

1. Find the unicode of the desired emoji from the [Full Emoji List](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html)
1. Convert it to HTML hexadicimal
    * ```U+1F601  --> &#x1F601```
1. Send message with emoji

```powershell
##############################################
# Method 1
##############################################
# get the unicode of the desired emoji
# https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html
$uniCodeEmoji = 'U+1F601'
# convert the unicode to a HTML hexadecimal reference
# U+1F601  --> &#x1F601
$hexEmoji = $uniCodeEmoji.Replace('U+','&#x')
# send message
Send-TelegramTextMessage -BotToken $token -ChatID $channel -Message "This is a smiley face: $hexEmoji"
```

#### Method 2

1. Send yourself an emoji message on telegram
1. Copy the emoji
1. Paste it into a PowerShell variable
1. Send message with emoji

```powershell
##############################################
# Method 2
##############################################
# send yourself an emoji telegram message with an emoji and copy it

# paste it into a variable
$emoji = 'ðŸ˜”'
# send message
Send-TelegramTextMessage -BotToken $token -ChatID $channel -Message "This is a sad face: $emoji"
```

### Why does PoshGram only support higher versions of PowerShell?

* *Why is PowerShell 6.1.0 (or higher) required? - Why can't I use 5.1?*
  * For new files to be uploaded and sent to a chat via bot, Telegram requires the use of multipart/form-data. This is not natively supported in 5.1. It is available in 6.0.0, but requires the manual creation of the form. 6.1.0 introduces native form capabilities. Functions that reference a URL, or that only use messaging  (**Send-TelegramTextMessage**) are 5.1 compatible. However, you would have to pull these functions out separately if you are absolutely set on using 5.1

* *I don't want to use PowerShell 6.1.0 (or higher) because I primarily use 5.1 or lower*
  * Good news - PowerShell 6.1.0+ installs to a completely separate folder, has a completely different exe (pwsh.exe), and references a different module path. This means you can install it on any system and use PoshGram while continuing to use any other version of PowerShell
  * Here is an example of how you can call PS 6.1 and use PoshGram from older versions of PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    #here is an example of calling PowerShell 6.1+ from PowerShell 5.1 to send a Telegram message with PoshGram
    & 'C:\Program Files\PowerShell\6\pwsh.exe' -command { Import-Module PoshGram;$token = "#########:xxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";$chat = "-nnnnnnnnn";Send-TelegramTextMessage -BotToken $token -ChatID $chat -Message "Test from 5.1 calling 6.1 to send Telegram Message via PoshGram" }
    ```

### Are there any restrictions when using PoshGram?

* Bots can currently send files of up to 50 MB in size
* Certain functions are limited to certain file extensions, see each function's documentation for more information
